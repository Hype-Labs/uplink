/**
 * A DriverManager is a collection of drivers that also behaves as a driver
 * itself. For example, when the driver manager is requested to start, all of
 * its drivers will be requested to start. This creates a point of convergence
 * in the drivers' states, while offering an API that enables managing drivers
 * in bundles as it was a driver itself. All delegate notifications for a driver
 * also apply to the DriverManager (NetworkDelegate and StateDelegate). The
 * manager's transport type corresponds to all driver's transport types ORed
 * together. The DriverManager is said to be RUNNING or STARTING if at least
 * one of its underlying drivers is RUNNING or STARTING as well, and IDLE iff
 * all of its drivers are IDLE. This abstracts away the details of each driver
 * and instead enables the SDK to work as a single unit for all types of
 * transport.
