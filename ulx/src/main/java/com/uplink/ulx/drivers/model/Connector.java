/**
 * A Connector is an abstract entity that manages connections. Connectors may
 * further be divided into two subtypes: active and passive. An active
 * connector is one that is capable of initiating the connection with another
 * device, while a passive connector is one that passively waits for the other
 * peer to be the initiator. This is common in technologies where devices can't
 * always be the initiators, such as Bluetooth Low Energy; in that case, one of
 * the devices (the central) waits passively for the other (the peripheral) to
 * initiate the connection, since centrals (GATT server) are not capable of
 * doing that themselves, as per the BLE protocol specification.
 *
 * The connectors have two types of delegates: a StateDelegate and an
 * InvalidationCallback. The former (StateDelegate) is useful for tracking the
 * connector's lifecycle events, such as the connector initiating or terminating
 * a connection. The latter (InvalidationCallback), triggers notifications that
 * are related to the moment when the connector becomes invalid, meaning that
 * it no longer serves the purpose of managing connections, and therefore must
 * be disposed.
