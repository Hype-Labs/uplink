/**
 * This is a base class for advertisers that implements common functionality
 * that is needed by all Advertiser implementations. It implements all basic
 * functionality that is common to advertisers, such as state management,
 * delegates, transport type, and so on. Being abstract, it leaves two methods
 * for children to implement: requestAdapterToStart() and requestAdapterToStop(),
 * which consist of methods that implement the specific logic for each different
 * transport. This leaves out the logic that is specific to each implementation,
 * while at the same time already implementing several conveniences for any new
 * implementations.
 * <br>
 *  CONTRACT: subclasses must hide their constructors, create a factory method(s) and
 *  call {@link AdvertiserCommons#initialize()} before returning the new instance
