/**
 * A StateManager is the entity responsible for managing the state of many
 * classes through the SDK implementation. Each stateful class (e.g. Connector,
 * Advertiser, Browser, etc), should encapsulate a state manager and subscribe
 * to its delegate (i.e. implement StateManager.Delegate). When requested for
 * some sort of activity, such as starting and stopping, those classes should
 * instead propagate the request to the state manager, which performs some state
 * verifications before committing the request through the delegate, with
 * requestStart and requestStop. This is mostly meant to prevent the overlap of
 * multiple simultaneous requests. When those activities are completed, the
 * implementations should again notify the StateManager of the outcome, through
 * one of the notifyXXX methods. For each situation, the StateManager will look
 * at the instance's state and decide how to act on the event.
