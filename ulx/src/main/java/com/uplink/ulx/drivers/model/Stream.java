 * that this abstraction works as basis for the other two. Therefore, a Stream
 * in itself is capable of neither input or output; rather, its InputStream
 * counterpart reads input, while its OutputStream counterpart writes output.
 * Both, however, share this abstraction in common. The abstraction enables
 * state management (Stream.State and Stream.StateDelegate), invalidation
 * observability (Stream.InvalidationCallback), and actions to open and close
 * the streams, among other utilities.
