 * sequence until the IOResult returned by it yields a byte count of zero, in
 * which case the stream is known to have been fully read. When that happens,
 * callers should not attempt to read any more data from it, and instead wait
 * for a delegate call to hasDataAvailable(InputStream), which will indicate
 * that the stream is then available to receive more read operations. An error
 * when reading from the stream does not invalidate it, but it still holds that

     * to hold its integrity, and therefore should be discarded. Since streams

     * returns a byte count (IOResult.getByteCount()) that is equal to the

     * the implementation should attempt to read again, even without getting a
     * delegate notification for that purpose. In other words, implementations
     * should read from the stream until IOResult.getByteCount() returns zero
     * or results in an error. After the data is read, it will be cleared from
     * the stream's buffer; this means that it becomes unrecoverable and cannot
