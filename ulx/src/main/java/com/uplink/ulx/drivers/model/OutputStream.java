 * checked with IOResult.getByteCount()) is equal to amount of bytes that are
 * being written to the stream and no error is given. In that case, the caller
 * should keep writing data to the stream until IOResult.getByteCount() returns
 * a byte count that is less than the amount of bytes that is being written.
