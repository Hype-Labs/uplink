/**
 * This class is similar to a serial {@link Executor} in that it executes tasks sequentially, but
 * the tasks can be asynchronous {@link #enqueue(Task)} returns a {@link Completable} which can be
 * marked as complete either during {@link Task#run(Completable)} or at any other moment. This is
 * especially useful when a task runs a request, for which we will get a response via some callback
 * later. Sample usage:
 * <pre> {@code
 * SerialOperationsManager manager = new SerialOperationsManager(
 *      new HandlerExecutor(new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()))
 * );
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * this.completable = manager.enqueue(completable -> gatt.writeCharacteristic(characteristic));
 *
 * //...
 *
 * public void onCharacteristicWrite(BluetoothGatt gatt, BluetoothGattCharacteristic characteristic, int status) {
 *      this.completable.markAsComplete(boolean);
 *      // Handle the result
 * }
 *
 * } </pre>
 * The class is thread-safe as long as the {@link Executor} passed to its constructor and the one
 * returned by {@link Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor()} are
