/**
 * The {@link IoController} is the entity that is responsible for converting
 * the stream's binary data into in-memory {@link Packet} objects. This module
 * registers encoders and decoders for all supported types of {@link Packet}s,
 * which will be the fundamental unit of communication between the devices. The
 * packets are encoded into and decoded from binary formats, which is what is
 * used in the communication links. Each packet gets decoded by other devices,
 * also by the {@link IoController}, which then propagates the decoded packet
 * objects through a {@link Delegate}. This class also manages intermediary
 * buffers for the streams. These correspond to buffers that hold the data
 * read from the streams, keeping the streams free. The packets are parsed from
 * those buffers. The current implementation is easy to break because the
 * buffers will keep growing until some sort of memory overflow occurs, although
 * that is something that should be fixed in the future.
