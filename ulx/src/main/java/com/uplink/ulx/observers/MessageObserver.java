/**

 * important to distinguish. A message being "sent" indicates that it was
 * written to the output streams, but not necessarily delivered to its
 * destination. This only means that the content is circulating on the network,
 * and as such might not have left the device yet. A message being "delivered",
 * on the other hand, indicates that its destination has acknowledge reception
 * and the content is already available on the end device.

     * about the original message. Currently, it only holds the message's
     * identifier, but more data can be used in the future. If the original
     * message was kept, the identifiers can be compared in order to map the
     * event with the message's content. This is motivated by the fact that the
     * SDK does not keep the message's data in order to save memory.
